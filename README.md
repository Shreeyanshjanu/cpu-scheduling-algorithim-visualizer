This Flutter-based application provides an interactive and comprehensive visualization platform for understanding CPU scheduling algorithms, a fundamental concept in Operating Systems. The tool helps students, developers, and educators visualize how different scheduling algorithms manage process execution, making complex theoretical concepts easy to grasp through real-time graphical representations.

üéØ Purpose & Goals
This repository aims to demystify CPU scheduling by providing:

Real-time process execution visualization through animated Gantt charts

Detailed performance metrics calculation including Response Time, Turnaround Time (TAT), Completion Time (CT), and Waiting Time

Multiple chart representations including bar charts, line graphs, and time trend analysis

Interactive input system allowing users to customize process arrival times, burst times, and priorities

Comparative analysis between different algorithms to determine optimal scheduling strategies

üöÄ Supported Scheduling Algorithms
First Come First Serve (FCFS) - Non-preemptive scheduling where processes execute in arrival order

Shortest Job First (SJF) - Prioritizes processes with shortest burst time for minimal waiting time

Priority Scheduling - Executes processes based on assigned priority levels

Round Robin (RR) - Time-sliced execution with configurable quantum for fair CPU distribution

And many more advanced scheduling techniques

üìä Key Features
Visual Components:

CPU Scheduling Table - Displays all timing metrics with color-coded process indicators

Gantt Chart - Shows process execution timeline with CPU idle time visualization

Bar Chart Comparison - Side-by-side comparison of Completion, Turnaround, Waiting, and Response times
